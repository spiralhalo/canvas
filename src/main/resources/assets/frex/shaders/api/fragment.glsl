 * Varying variables for generic use. Shader authors are
 * encouraged to exhaust these before creating new custom varyings.
 *
 * This is necessary because custom shaders may be consolidated
 * into a single shader with logic controlled via uniforms or vertex data.
 * This is done either to reduce draw calls or as a way to achieve
 * sorted translucency with mixed custom shaders.
 *
 * If we do not reuse varying variable, then three bad things can happen:
 *   1) Naming conflicts (could be avoided with care)
 *   2) Exceed hardware/driver limits
 *   3) Wasteful interpolation if unused varyings aren't stripped by the compiler.
 *
 * Authors do not need to worry about conflicting usage of these variables
 * by other shaders in the same compilation - only a single pair of custom
 * vertex/fragment shaders will be active for a single polygon.
